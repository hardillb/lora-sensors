# LoRa Temperture/Humidity Sensor code

This code runs on a Adafruit LoRa 32u4 Feather with a
DH22 temperature and humidity sensor attacted.

As well as publishing temp/humidity data it also sends
the current battery voltage to give some indication of the 
remaining charge.


You will also need to manually install the RadioHead library
